    <h1>Description</h1>

    <p>
      Adelfa is an interactive proof assistant for reasoning about
      specifications written in the Edinburgh Logical Framework (LF).
      The logic underlying Adelfa is one which is focused on reasoning about
      properties of LF derivability.
      LF typing derivations are the atomic formulas and the semantics is based
      on an understanding of derivability in LF.
      The logic provides mechanisms for case analysis and for reasoning
      inductively based on the height of derivations in LF.
      Another feature of the logic is the ability to reason generally about
      contexts through the use of context variables classified by schemas
      identifying a regular structure.
