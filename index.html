    <h1>Description</h1>

    <p>
      Adelfa is an interactive proof assistant for reasoning about
      specifications written in the Edinburgh Logical Framework (LF).
      Adelfa is based on a new logic named &#x1D4DB;<sub>LF</sub> whose atomic
      formulas 
      represent typing judgements in LF and in which complex formulas can be
      constructed using the usual collection of propositional connectives and
      quantifiers over variables representing LF terms and
      contexts. Quantification over terms is qualified by <i>arity types</i>
      that indicate functional structure but that leave dependency information
      to the domain of the body of the formula.
      Context quantification is governed by a special kind of type, referred to
      as a <i>context schema</i>, that describes a finite collection of patterns
      of declarations out of which an instantiating (ground) context may be
      constructed.
      The meaning of formulas in this logic is described by using derivability
      in LF to determine the validity of ground atomic formulas and attributing
      a substitution semantics to the quantifiers. 	  
      Complementing the logic is a proof system that provides the basis for
      establishing the validity of formulas in the logic.
      Particular proof rules in this proof system embody a means for carrying
      out case analyses relative to LF derivability and for reasoning
      inductively over the heights of LF derivations.
      The logic also provides a flexible basis for additional rules, such as
      ones that encode meta-theorems related to derivability in LF. Adelfa
      implements a collection of such rules as well.

      An expository presentation of Adelfa can be found in the paper entitled
      <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~eptcs/paper.cgi?LFMTP2021:14">"Adelfa:
      A system for reasoning about LF specifications."</a> The reader may also

      small, but growing, number of
      <a href="examples/index.html">reasoning
      examples</a> that are currently available.
      A detailed theoretical development of the logic underlying Adelfa is to be found
