TODO:

[x] create the skeleton of main page for Adelfa
[x] Update script for pushing to the web directory
[x] Include a brief description of the system on page
      can use existing attempt from systems/lf-reasoning or a revised description
[x] Determine where the Adelfa repo (or tar ball for now) will live and include on main page
[x] Use the system reference file to create a system reference page
[ ] Use the sample interaction (or another example) to create a simple walkthrough page
[x] Create a landing page for examples
      note: will not be able to create pages for examples until scripts are updated
[?] Update README for building Adelfa web page
      note: this is only done if the same structure as with compiler correctness works,
            which we will not know until makefiles and scripts are working.

[ ] Update ruby scripts for Adelfa
