TODO:

[x] create the skeleton of main page for Adelfa
[x] Update script for pushing to the web directory
[x] Include a brief description of the system on page
      can use existing attempt from systems/lf-reasoning or a revised description
[x] Determine where the Adelfa repo (or tar ball for now) will live and include on main page
[x] Use the system reference file to create a system reference page
[x] Use the sample interaction (or another example) to create a simple walkthrough page
[x] Create a landing page for examples
      note: will not be able to create pages for examples until scripts are updated
[ ] Update README for building Adelfa web page
      note: this is only done if the same structure as with compiler correctness works,
            which we will not know until makefiles and scripts are working.
[x] Add acknowledgements to main page
[x] Update ruby scripts for Adelfa
[ ] Create Makefiles for generating webpage
[ ] Add basic navigation support (eg. return to main page, top, etc.)
[ ] create a logo/icon for the system
[ ] Determine if possible to display Specification file directly on example page, like Adelfa
[ ] Set up makefile that will run ruby scripts on all example subdirectory
