# Top-level commands

## `Theorem <NAME> : <FORMULA>.`

Starts proof development with the given formula as the goal.

## `Quit.`

Exits from Adelfa.

## `Specification <QUOTED FILENAME>`

Reads in the specification indicated by the given filename.

## `Schema <ID> := {w x ...}(y:A,z:B ...); ...`.

Defines a context schema associated with `<ID>`. For example:

```adelfa
Schema c := {T:o}(x: tm, d: of x T);
            (x:tm, t:tp, d: of x t).
```

## `Set <OPTION> <VALUE>.`

Sets the value of options during proof development. It may be used at the top
level or inside theorem construction. The options are currently:

- `search_depth` The maximum number of times to perform type decomposition on
  assumption judgements during the [`search`](#search-num) and
  [`assert`](#assert-formula-num) tactics. By default, this is set to 5.
