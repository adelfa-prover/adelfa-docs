# Syntax

## Terms

The syntax for terms Canonical LF terms and types follows a similar style to
that used by [Twelf](https://twelf.org/). Of note are the following structures:

| Syntax    | Meaning                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| `[x] M`   | Term abstraction                |
| `{x:A} B` | $\Pi$-type                      |
| `A -> B`  | $\Pi$-type without dependencies |

The names for variables and constants follow the same conventions as
[Twelf](https://twelf.org/). Nominal constants are denoted by `n1, n2, ...`

## Context Expressions

Context expressions $G$ are commonly expressed using the
following syntax:

| Syntax           | Meaning                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| \<empty string\> | Empty context          |
| `Gamma`          | Context variable       |
| `G, n:A`         | Explicit context entry |

## Formulas

The syntax for formulas is the following:

| Syntax                           | Meaning                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `forall x y z ..., F`            | $\forall x\ \forall y\ \forall z \ldots . F$ (Universal quantification)                      |
| `exists x y z ..., F`            | $\exists x\ \exists y\ \exists z \ldots . F$ (Existential quantification)                    |
| `ctx Gamma1:C1 Gamma2:C2 ..., F` | $\Pi \Gamma_1:\mathcal{C_1}\ \Pi \Gamma_2:\mathcal{C_2}\ \ldots. F$ (Context quantification) |
| `F1 => F2`                       | $F_1 \supset F_2$ (Implication)                                                              |
| `F1 /\ F2`                       | $F_1 \land F_2$ (Conjunction)                                                                |
| `F1 \/ F2`                       | $F_1 \lor F_2$ (Disjunction)                                                                 |
| `{ G \|- M : A }`               | Atomic formula                                                                               |
| `pred M1 M2`                     | Defined predicate                                                                            |
| `true`                           | $\top$ (true)                                                                                |
| `false`                          | $\bot$ (false)                                                                               |


## Lemmas

To use a lemma, prove it as a theorem and then refer to it by name in another
proof using the [`apply`](/reference-guide/tactics#apply-name-to-hyp-names-with-bindings) tactic. For example,

```adelfa
Theorem my_lemma : ...
...

Theorem my_theorem : ...
...
apply my_lemma to H3 H5.
```

## Typing

Adelfa's logic is simply-typed using simple arity typing based on a single base
type `o` and constructor `->`. All terms and formulas must be well-typed.

## Inductive Restrictions

Inductive restrictions are represented by `*` (smaller) and `@` (equal). They are
used to track the size of inductive arguments rather than using explicit numeric
values. For example, suppose we apply `induction on 1.` when trying to prove the
following subject reduction theorem,

```adelfa
============================
forall E V T D1 D2, {|- D1 : eval E V} -> {|- D2: of E T} ->
  exists D3, {|- D3: of V T}
```

We will get the following proof state.

```adelfa /@/ /*/
IH : forall E V T D1 D2, {|- D1 : eval E V}* -> {|- D2: of E T} ->
      exists D3, {|- D3: of V T}
============================
forall E V T D1 D2, {|- D1 : eval E V}@ -> {|- D2: of E T} ->
  exists D3, {|- D3: of V T}
```


Here we have an inductive hypothesis where the inductive argument is flagged
with `*`. This means that we can only apply that hypothesis to an argument which
also has the `*`. Because `*` means smaller, in order to get an argument with a
`*` we must perform case analysis on an argument that is "equal" which we denote
by `@`. Thus, the above proof proceeds by first doing `intros.` and then case
analysis on `{|- D1 : eval E V}@`. This will give us two subgoals, one which is
trivial and the other which has hypotheses tagged with `*` and thus eligible for
use with the inductive hypothesis.
