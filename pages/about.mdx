# About

Adelfa is a part of [The Sparrow Project](https://sparrow.cs.umn.edu/), led by
[Prof. Gopalan Nadathur](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~ngopalan/). It is a proof
assistant for the [LF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_framework) logical
framework.

## Similar Projects

LF is a well-studied logical framework, and there are many proof assistants that
are built on top of it. Some of the more well-known ones are
[Twelf](http://www.twelf.org/) and [Beluga](https://beluga-lang.org/).
Discussions of the similarities and differences of these systems can be found in
publications.

Adelfa has taken great inspiration from the [Abella proof
assistant](https://abella-prover.org/) architecturally. Much of the user
interactions with the proof assistant are due to the influence of Abella.
