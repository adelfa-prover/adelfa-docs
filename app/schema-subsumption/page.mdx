# Transporting Theorems Across Context Schemas


Prior to reading the discussion within this page, it's necessary to have a rough
understanding of the syntax of Adelfa and tactics of Adelfa. We recommend the
reader explore the provided [walkthrough](/walkthrough) or have the [reference
guide](/reference-guide) at hand. You may also search using the search bar in
the top right to look up terms.

Some code blocks in the examples show the proof state after each command if the
terminating symbol (`.`) is hovered over or clicked. The latter method allows
easier scrolling in larger outputs. For example

```adelfa showOutput
Theorem hover-example : false => true.
intros. case H1.

%{
>> Theorem hover-example : false => true.

Subgoal hover-example:


==================================
False => True

hover-example>> intros.

Subgoal hover-example:

H1:False

==================================
True

hover-example>> case H1.
Proof Completed!
}%
```

We discuss a series of examples which utilize _schema subsumption_ in Adelfa, a
capability in Adelfa which allows one to transport the validity of a formula
$\Pi \Gamma{:}\mathcal{C}.F$ into one with the context variable typed by a
different context schema. When in the scope of Adelfa, this amounts to taking a
theorem with a context variable quantification which has been proven, such as
one of the form:

```adelfa
Schema C := ...

Theorem transport-ex : ctx G:C, ...
```

and determining when the same proof can be used to complete the same theorem
under a different context schema:

```adelfa
Schema C' := ...

Theorem transport-ex' : ctx G:C', ...
```

These examples are intended to be complementary to the paper "Transporting
Theorems about Typeability in LF Across Schematically Defined Contexts" but aim
to be as self-contained as possible. We suggest reading the following examples
in the order presented below as they are intended to build on each other.

Adelfa will always transport a proof if it's able to by default. If you would
like to follow along with the examples, we recommend using `Set schema_sub
false.` in sections are discussing how the proof would proceed without using the
transport rule.


1. [Every lambda calculus term has a size](/schema-subsumption/size) displays a
   straightforward use of theorem transport and discusses alternatives as well
   as their downsides.
2. [Size of lambda calculus terms does not decrease after
   substitution](/schema-subsumption/subst-size) shows the use of transport in
   a larger development order to bring out how avoiding transport causes more
   work as one's development grows.
3. [ORBI](/schema-subsumption/orbi) completes a standardized benchmark for
   what is referred to as "Non-Linear Context Extensions," which schema
   subsumption permits.
