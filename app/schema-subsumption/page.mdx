# Transporting Theorems Across Context Schemas


Prior to reading the discussion within this page, it's necessary to have a rough
understanding of the syntax of Adelfa and tactics of Adelfa. An explanation of
these can be found in the [Reference Guide](/reference-guide). One may also
search using the search bar in the top right to look up terms.

We discuss a series of examples which utilize _schema subsumption_ in Adelfa, a
capability in Adelfa which allows one to transport the validity of a formula
$$\Pi \Gamma{:}\mathcal{C}.F$$ into one with the context variable typed by a
different context schema. When in the scope of Adelfa, this amounts to taking a
theorem with a context variable quantification which has been proven, such as
one of the form:

```adelfa
Schema C := ...

Theorem transport-ex : ctx G:C, ...
```

and determining when the same proof can be used to complete the same theorem
under a different context schema:

```adelfa
Schema C' := ...

Theorem transport-ex' : ctx G:C', ...
```

These examples are intended to be complementary to the paper "Transporting
Theorems about Typeability in LF Across Schematically Defined Contexts" but aim
to be as self-contained as possible. We suggest reading the following examples
in the order presented below as they are intended to build on each other.


1. [Every lambda calculus terms has a size](/schema-subsumption/size) displays a
   straightforward use of theorem transport and discusses alternatives as well
   as their downsides.
2. [Size of lambda calculus terms does not decrease after
   substitution](/schema-subsumption/subst-size) shows the use of transport in
   a larger development order to bring out how avoiding transport causes more
   work as one's development grows.
3. [ORBI](/schema-subsumption/orbi) completes a standardized benchmark for
   what is referred to as "Non-Linear Context Extensions," which schema
   subsumption permits.
