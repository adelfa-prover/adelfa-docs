# A Description of Schema Subsumption in Beluga

[Beluga](https://complogic.cs.mcgill.ca/beluga/) is a functional programming
language which allows one to reason about a formal system. It shares many
properties to [Twelf](https://twelf.org) in that one defines the system via
dependent types and writes total functions which constitute proofs about this
system. It is more expressive than Twelf, for example, it allows explicit
reasoning about contexts.

Beluga implements schema subsumption which accomplishes the same goal as what
the transport rule in Adelfa does. However, to the best of our knowledge, there
is not a precise description of how one decides when one schema subsumes
another.

The best reference is that of [The Next 700 Challenge Problems for Reasoning
with Higher-Order Abstract Syntax
Representations](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10817-015-9327-3).
It displays Beluga's schema subsumption in the context of a proof relating to
algorithmic equality of the polymorphic lambda calculus. It proves a series of
lemmas under the schema `schema atpG = block (a:tp,v:atp a a);{:txt}`. It then
argues that it can lift these lemmas into the schema `schema aeqG = block
(x:tm,u:aeq x x) + block (a:tp,v:atp a a);{:txt}` by:

> When we call a function that requires a context $\gamma$ of schema `atpG` but we
> have a context of schema `aeqG`, we check that every block `b` in schema `atpG` is
> a prefix of a block `b'` in the schema `aeqG` and moreover additional declarations
> present in `b'` are irrelevant to the declarations in `b`. The type checker therefore
> allows us to pass a context of schema `aeqG` whenever a context `atpG` is
> required.

However, this seems to be the wrong direction of argument. Checking that every
block of `atpG` has a corresponding one in `aeqG` does not suffice, for example
`aeqG` could have additional blocks which the lemma has not accounted for. The
lifting here is okay since the additional block in `aeqG` does not relate to the
lemmas directly, but a small example which shows it is unsound is:

```beluga
LF tm: type =
| lam: (tm -> tm) -> tm
;

LF aeq: tm -> tm -> type =
| ae_l : ({x : tm} aeq x x -> aeq (M x) (N x))
          -> aeq (lam (\x. M x)) (lam (\x. N x))
;

schema xaG = block x:tm, ae_v:aeq x x;

rec reflG: {gamma:xaG} {M:[gamma |- tm]} [gamma |- aeq M M] =
mlam gamma => mlam M => case [gamma |- M] of
| [gamma |- #p.1] => [gamma |- #p.2]
| [gamma |- lam \x. M] =>
  let [gamma, b:block y:tm, ae_v:aeq y y |- D[.., b.1, b.2]] =
        reflG [gamma, b:block y:tm, ae_v:aeq y y] [gamma, b |- M[.., b.1]]
  in
   [gamma |- ae_l \x. \w. D]
;

schema xaGBad = block (x:tm, ae_v:aeq x x) + block (x : tm);

% This should not be provable. It cannot deal with a `block (x : tm)`

rec reflGBad: {gamma:xaGBad} {M:[gamma |- tm]} [gamma |- aeq M M] =
mlam gamma => mlam M => reflG [gamma] [gamma |- M]
;
```

In this example, `reflGBad` claims that the proof will hold even though there
may be terms in the context which do not have a derivation that it is
algorithmically equal to itself. A [GitHub
issue](https://github.com/Beluga-lang/Beluga/issues/276) has been created to
track this error.
