# About

Adelfa is a part of [The Sparrow Project](https://sparrow.cs.umn.edu/), led by
[Prof. Gopalan Nadathur](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~ngopalan/). It is a proof
assistant for reasoning about specifications encoded in the Edinburgh Logical
Framework [@harper93jacm].

## Similar Projects

Some well-known systems which are related to Adelfa are
[Twelf](http://www.twelf.org/) and
[Beluga](https://complogic.cs.mcgill.ca/beluga/). Discussions of the
similarities and differences of these systems can be found in
[publications](/publications).

Adelfa has taken great inspiration from the [Abella proof
assistant](https://abella-prover.org/) architecturally. Much of the user
interactions with the proof assistant are due to the influence of Abella.

## Contributors

The logic underlying Adelfa was developed by [Gopalan
Nadathur](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~ngopalan/) and [Mary
Southern](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~south163/). The logic is described in
in [@nadathur21arxiv].

The initial implementation of Adelfa was completed by [Mary
Southern](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~south163/) as part of their Ph.D. work.
It is currently developed and maintained by [Chase Johnson](https://chasej.dev/)
as a part of his Ph.D. work.

The Adelfa project logo and branding were designed by [Sully
Dyvad](https://sullydyvad.com/).
