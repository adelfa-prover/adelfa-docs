## Installation

There are several ways to obtain Adelfa. We recommend using
[opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/), the OCaml package manager, to install Adelfa.
However, you can also clone the code from github or download the source code
directly from this website.

<Tabs items={['opam', 'git', 'source']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The recommended way for installing Adelfa is through OPAM.

    ```bash
    opam install adelfa
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The code for Adelfa is hosted on
    [Github](https://github.com/adelfa-prover/adelfa). You can clone the
    repository and install the code using Dune.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adelfa-prover/adelfa.git
    cd adelfa
    dune install
    ```

    You may also obtain the source code by downloading [the latest release from Github](https://github.com/adelfa-prover/adelfa/releases/latest).

## VSCode Support

We provide a [VSCode
extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adelfa.adelfa-vscode)
for developing proofs in Adelfa. The extension is in active development so it
may have issues. If you encounter any issues, please [report
them](https://github.com/adelfa-prover/adelfa-vscode/issues). For a more robust
experience, we recommend using the [Emacs/Proof General
setup](#emacs-proof-general-support).

## Emacs / Proof General Support

The distribution of Adelfa provides a [Proof
General](https://proofgeneral.github.io/) mode and syntax highlighting for
developing proofs in its `PG/` directory which has the following structure:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="PG" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="adelfa" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="adelfa-syntax.el"/>
      <FileTree.File name="adelfa.el"/>
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="README.md"/>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>




<Steps>
### Install Proof General

Install Proof General as instructed by its documentation at
https://proofgeneral.github.io/download/.

### Add Adelfa to Proof General Source

Copy the entirety of the `adelfa` directory into folder where Proof General was
installed. The folder structure should now resemble:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="adelfa" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="adelfa-syntax.el"/>
    <FileTree.File name="adelfa.el"/>
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.Folder name="ci"/>
  <FileTree.Folder name="coq"/>
  <FileTree.Folder name="generic">
    <FileTree.File name="proof-site.el"/>
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name="proof-general.el"/>
</FileTree>

### Setup Adelfa in Proof General

In the file `PG/generic/proof-site.el{:txt}`, add an entry for Adelfa in PG's
`proof-assistant-table-default{:lisp}` resembling `(adelfa "Adelfa" "ath"){:lisp}`. The
`proof-assistant-table-default{:lisp}` should resemble something similar to:

```lisp
(defconst proof-assistant-table-default
    '(
      ;; Main instances of PG.

      (adelfa "Adelfa" "ath")
      (coq "Coq" "v" nil (".vo" ".glob"))
      ; ...
     ))
```

### Complete Proof General Setup

In your Emacs configuration, commonly located at `~/.emacs{:txt}` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el{:txt}`, add the following lines:

```lisp
(defconst proof-site-file
  (expand-file-name "path-to-pg/PG/generic/proof-site.el"))

(when (file-exists-p proof-site-file)
  (setq proof-splash-enable nil
        proof-output-tooltips nil
        proof-three-window-mode-policy 'horizontal)

  (load-file proof-site-file)

  (add-hook 'adelfa-mode-hook
            #'(lambda ()
                (setq indent-line-function 'indent-relative)))

  (setq auto-mode-alist
        (append
         '(("\\.ath\\'" . adelfa-mode))
         auto-mode-alist)))
```

Where `path-to-pg{:txt}` should be changed to the file path of your proof general
installation.
