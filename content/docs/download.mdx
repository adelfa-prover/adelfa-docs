## Installation

There are several ways to obtain Adelfa. We recommend using
[opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/), the OCaml package manager, to install Adelfa.
However, you can also clone the code from GitHub or download the source code
directly from this website.

    The recommended way for installing Adelfa is through OPAM.

    ```bash
    opam install adelfa
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    The code for Adelfa is hosted on
    [Github](https://github.com/adelfa-prover/adelfa). You can clone the
    repository and install the code using Dune.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adelfa-prover/adelfa.git
    cd adelfa
    dune install
    ```

## VSCode Support

We provide a [VSCode
extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adelfa.adelfa-vscode)
for developing proofs in Adelfa. The extension is in active development so it
may have issues. If you encounter any issues, please [report
them](https://github.com/adelfa-prover/adelfa-vscode/issues). For a more robust
experience, we recommend using the [Emacs/Proof General
setup](#emacs--proof-general-support).

## Emacs / Proof General Support

The distribution of Adelfa provides a [Proof
General](https://proofgeneral.github.io/) mode and syntax highlighting for
developing proofs in its `PG/` directory which has the following structure:

<Files>
  <Folder name="PG" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="adelfa" defaultOpen>
      <File name="adelfa-syntax.el" />
      <File name="adelfa.el" />
    </Folder>
    <File name="README.md" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

<Steps>
<Step>
### Install Proof General

Install Proof General as instructed by its documentation at
https://proofgeneral.github.io/download/.

</Step>

<Step>
### Add Adelfa to Proof General Source

Copy the entirety of the `adelfa` directory into the folder where Proof General was
installed. The folder structure should now resemble:

<Files>
  <Folder name="adelfa" defaultOpen>
    <File name="adelfa-syntax.el"/>
    <File name="adelfa.el"/>
  </Folder>
  <Folder name="ci"/>
  <Folder name="coq"/>
  <Folder name="generic">
    <File name="proof-site.el"/>
  </Folder>
  <File name="proof-general.el"/>
</Files>
</Step>

<Step>
### Setup Adelfa in Proof General

In the file `PG/generic/proof-site.el`, add an entry for Adelfa in PG's
`proof-assistant-table-default` resembling `(adelfa "Adelfa" "ath")`. The
`proof-assistant-table-default` should resemble something similar to:

```lisp
(defconst proof-assistant-table-default
    '(
      ;; Main instances of PG.

      (adelfa "Adelfa" "ath")
      (coq "Coq" "v" nil (".vo" ".glob"))
      ; ...
     ))
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Complete Proof General Setup

In your Emacs configuration, commonly located at `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el`, add the following lines:

```lisp
(defconst proof-site-file
  (expand-file-name "path-to-pg/PG/generic/proof-site.el"))

(when (file-exists-p proof-site-file)
  (setq proof-splash-enable nil
        proof-output-tooltips nil
        proof-three-window-mode-policy 'horizontal)

  (load-file proof-site-file)

  (add-hook 'adelfa-mode-hook
            #'(lambda ()
                (setq indent-line-function 'indent-relative)))

  (setq auto-mode-alist
        (append
         '(("\\.ath\\'" . adelfa-mode))
         auto-mode-alist)))
```

Where `path-to-pg` should be changed to the file path of your proof general
installation.
