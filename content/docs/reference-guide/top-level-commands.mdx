## `Theorem <NAME> : <FORMULA>.`

Starts proof development with the given formula as the goal.

```adelfa
Theorem myTheorem : forall M N P, ...
```

## `Quit.`

Exits from Adelfa.

## `Specification <QUOTED FILENAME>.`

Reads in the specification indicated by the given filename.

## `Schema <ID> := <BLOCK SCHEMA>[; <BLOCK SCHEMA>].`

Defines a context schema associated with `<ID>`.

A block schema has a, possibly empty, header of arity typed variables, followed
by a series of, possibly empty, LF typed variables. A context schema can be
comprised of any number of block schemas.

For example:

```adelfa
Schema C := {T:o}(x: tm, d: of x T);
            (x:tm, t:tp, d: of x t).
```

## `Set <OPTION> <VALUE>.`

Sets the value of options during proof development. It may be used at the top
level or inside theorem construction. The options are currently:

- `search_depth` The maximum number of times to
  perform type decomposition on assumption judgements during the
  [`search`](/reference-guide/tactics#search-num) and
  [`assert`](/reference-guide/tactics#assert-formula-num) tactics.
  Accepts any number as a `<VALUE>`. By default, this is set to 5.
- `schema_sub` The option to enable or disable [schema
  subsumption](/theory/schema-subsumption). Accepts `true` or `false`. By default, this is set to `true`.

```adelfa
Set search_depth 5.

Set schema_sub false.

Set search_depth 5, schema_sub false.
```
